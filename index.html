            <h2>THINK BEFORE YOU POST</h2>
            <h3>Safe and Responsible Use of Information Technology</h3>
            <p class="content-paragraph">In today’s digital age, posting content online has become a part of our daily lives. However, every post we share leaves a lasting impression—not just about who we are, but also on the people and communities around us. It is essential to think critically and responsibly before hitting the "post" button to ensure that our words and actions online align with our values and respect the feelings and privacy of others.</p>
            <p class="content-paragraph">The "Think Before You Post" project encourages students to create reflective questions that act as a checklist before sharing anything online. These questions will serve as a guide for thoughtful and mindful posting, helping students evaluate their content for accuracy, kindness, and appropriateness. Through this project, students will develop a deeper understanding of digital responsibility and the power of their online presence.</p>
